# Compliance Deadline Tracker — RegTech Demo (AI-Generated)

This project is a small but meaningful RegTech feature built using **100% AI-generated code** (“vibe coding”).  
It helps early-stage Australian startups **track compliance deadlines** such as ASIC Annual Reviews, BAS, PAYG, STP, and Super.

🚀 Live demo: https://regtech-deadline-tracker.vercel.app  
🔌 Backend API docs: https://regtech-deadline-tracker.onrender.com/swagger/index.html

## 🎯 Feature & RegTech Pain Point

Australian founders frequently miss regulatory filings because deadlines are tracked in spreadsheets, emails, or a founder’s memory.

This demo solves one specific pain point:

> “Show me all compliance deadlines that are upcoming or overdue, allow me to tick them off, and make sure I don’t forget anything.”

The feature includes:

- List of regulatory deadlines
- Clear **overdue / due soon / upcoming** labels
- Colour indicators (🔴 overdue / 🟢 upcoming or completed)
- One-click **Mark done**
- A popup that summarises **overdue + due-soon deadlines** when the user opens the app

Small feature — **big impact** on fines, stress, and accountant time.

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

| Layer      | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| Frontend  | React + Vite |
| Backend   | Go (in-memory storage) |
| Database  | None — simple and free to run |
| Deployment | Frontend on **Vercel**, Backend on **Render** |

### Backend

- Exposes REST API endpoints:
  - `GET /api/deadlines`
  - `POST /api/deadlines`
  - `POST /api/deadlines/:id/complete`
  - `GET /api/deadlines/summary`
- Stores deadlines in memory (no DB)
- Seeds real AU regulatory obligations as sample data

### Frontend

- Pages and components:
  - `DeadlinesPage`
  - `DeadlineForm`
  - `DeadlineList`
  - `DeadlineItem`
  - `OverdueSummaryModal`
- State management via custom hook `useDeadlines`
- Optimistic UI when marking as done
- Environment variable for backend URL

## 💻 Running the App

### Local – Backend

```bash
cd backend
go run ./cmd/server

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 🤖 Vibe-Coding Process (AI-only development)

The assignment required **zero manual business-logic typing**.  
My role was **architect + reviewer**, not typist.

### Tools Used

- ChatGPT (GPT-5) — main coding assistant

### Development flow

1. **Design & modelling with AI**
   - Asked AI to propose the domain model and REST endpoints for AU compliance obligations.
2. **Backend generation**
   - AI generated handlers, router, models, and in-memory repository.
3. **Frontend generation**
   - AI generated components, hooks, modal workflow, and optimistic update.
4. **Iteration & debugging**
   - When something didn’t work, I explained the issue in natural language
     and let AI regenerate the fix.

Examples of prompts used:

```
Mark-done does not update the UI. Fix the state logic so it treats items immutably.
```

```
Deadlines due today are marked overdue. Rewrite comparison to operate on date only.
```

### Takeaway

AI is extremely fast at generating working software, but **human architecture and feedback are essential**.

## 🧪 QA / Manual Quality Checks

Even without automated tests, I validated:

- Add deadline → appears correctly
- Mark done → status and colour update
- Overdue / due-today logic behaves correctly
- Summary popup appears only when relevant
- Refresh keeps correct state
- Network failure shows friendly error instead of crash

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Email reminders before deadlines
- Calendar sync (Google / Outlook)
- Xero / MYOB integration
- Multi-user workspaces with auth
- Database (Supabase / PostgreSQL)
